### Congratulations!

Youâ€™ve been commissioned to build SupaHotFire: a user interface for keeping records of famous rappers. Grand Hustle records will use this user interface as a way to view their database of rappers.

### Implement a React application that does the following:

* Displays a table of Rappers on pageload, populated by the API

### Guidelines

* Using a flux architecture library such as Redux is recommended but optional
* You may import whatever libraries or React elements you wish.
* Have fun!

### Set-up instructions

Clone this repo and run `npm install` in the root directory to install our [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) npm package. (Note: you do not need to install JSON-server separately!) Run `npm start` to initialize the dummy API server. While it's running, you can access the API via `localhost:3000` by default. Navigating to that page in a browser will show the API spec. If you receive an error saying the port is in use, simply change the `--port 3000` option in package.json to a different port number. Try opening up `http://localhost:3000/rappers` to preview the JSON payload of rappers. 

Finally run the UI via `npm run dev` on another terminal window instance and open up `localhost:9000` in your browser to see the UI.

### Take Home Instructions

Please send back your projects either in a zipped format or upload your project to your github profile and share the link. If you do upload your project to GitHub, please remove the repo once you hear back from Peak6 so that it preserves the integrity of this exercise. Thank you!# PeakTest
